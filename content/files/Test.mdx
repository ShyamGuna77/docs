## Getting Started

You can use the built-in `<Mermaid />` component to render diagrams.

### Example: URL Shortener Flow



<Mermaid
  chart="
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as Frontend (Website/App)
    participant BE as Backend (API Server)
    participant DB as Database
    participant R as Redirect Service

    U->>FE: Enter long URL
    FE->>BE: Send request (POST /shorten { longUrl })
    BE->>DB: Save mapping (shortId â†’ longUrl)
    DB-->>BE: Confirmation (shortId created)
    BE-->>FE: Return short URL
    FE-->>U: Show short URL

    Note over U,FE: Later, when user visits short URL

    U->>R: Request short URL
    R->>DB: Lookup shortId
    DB-->>R: Return original long URL
    R-->>U: Redirect to long URL
